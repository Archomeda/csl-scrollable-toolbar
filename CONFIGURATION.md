# Configurations

Scrollable Toolbar supports various configurations. They are saved in
`ScrollableToolbar.xml` in the
local mod folder. On Windows, this is
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Colossal Order\Cities_Skylines\Addons\Mods\ScrollableToolbar`.

## Features
*Italic values* are the default values. The following settings can be found in
the `Features` tree:

 Feature                   | Key name                   | Supported values
 ------------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------
 Scrolling on toolbar      | ToolbarScrolling           | *true*, false
 Switch toolbar width mode | ToolbarToggleExtendedWidth | *true*, false

## State
These settings are found in the `State` tree. Please do not change any of these,
unless you know what you're doing. I'm not responsible if you broke your game.
