# Cities Skylines: Common Shared Library
[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/n8d0t6pp7x3b0gel/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Archomeda/csl-common-shared-library/branch/master)

This small library is used for my own mods to prevent duplicated code across
multiple mods. You can use it for your own mods as well, but keep in mind that
this library is not complete and may have breaking changes over time. It only
contains various classes that I only needed myself. You can, however, submit
pull requests in order to include more functionality if you want.

## Usage
***Note:*** *Please do* ***not*** *upload this as a separate mod on the Steam
Workshop! I won't authorize any request!*

This library is meant to be **included within your mod**. The reason for this,
is that this library will have multiple versions at some point, and they might
be incompatible with each other. By including it and giving it an unique version
number, we prevent this incompatibility (versioning is done automatically upon
building). The game will automatically use the correct version you compiled
against (meaning, the one you ship with your mod).

You can include it within your mod in multiple ways, but the way I've done it
(for now), is by creating a git subtree for the mods that depend on this
library. You can take a look at
[Scrollable Toolbar](https://github.com/Archomeda/csl-scrollable-toolbar) or
[Ambient Sound Tuner](https://github.com/Archomeda/csl-ambient-sounds-tuner) as
examples.

It's possible that I'll change this method at some point, but that depends
entirely on how extensively I'm using this.

### Compilation Notes
Please note that setting up your development environment is a bit different from
the Cities Skylines wiki. Instead of hardcoding various dependencies in the
solution file, you have to specify the path yourself as a user configuration
that will not be pushed to the repo. In order to do this, after you have opened
the project in Visual Studio, go to the project settings, reference paths, and
add your `SteamApps/Common/Cities_Skylines/Cities_Data/Managed` folder there.

Also, please refrain from adding those hardcoded references in the solution
file if you want to submit a pull request.
